## 1. The STAR Method

When answering behavioral questions, use the **STAR** method to structure your response clearly:

-   **S - Situation**: Describe the context or challenge.
-   **T - Task**: Explain your role and what needed to be done.
-   **A - Action**: Detail the specific steps *you* took (focus on "I", not "We").
-   **R - Result**: ongoing Outcome, metrics, or lessons learned.

## 2. Common Behavioral Questions

### 1. "Tell me about a challenging project."
*   **Key points**: Focus on a technical challenge (e.g., scaling, debugging, complex logic).
*   **Structure**:
    *   **S**: "We were building a real-time chat app..."
    *   **T**: "My task was to handle message synchronization..."
    *   **A**: "I implemented WebSockets with Redis Pub/Sub..."
    *   **R**: "Latency dropped by 50% and we handled 10k users."

### 2. "How do you handle tight deadlines?"
*   **Key points**: Prioritization, communication, trade-offs.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **S**: "We had a critical feature launch in 2 days..."
    *   **A**: "I prioritized the MVP features, communicated the scope cut to the PM, and focused on core functionality."
    *   **R**: "We launched on time with a stable build, adding the rest later."

### 3. "Describe a time you debugged a difficult bug."
*   **Key points**: Process, tools, persistence.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **S**: "Production server was crashing randomly..."
    *   **A**: "I analyzed logs, used bisect to find the commit, and discovered a memory leak in..."
    *   **R**: "Fixed the leak, added monitoring to prevent recurrence."

### 4. "How do you handle conflict with a team member?"
*   **Key points**: Empathy, professional communication, resolution.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **S**: "My peer disagreed with my database schema choice..."
    *   **A**: "I set up a meeting, listened to their concerns, benchmarked both solutions..."
    *   **R**: "We agreed on a hybrid approach that was better than both original ideas."

## 3. Resume & Portfolio Tips

### Resume
-   **One Page**: Unless you have 10+ years of experience.
-   **Action Verbs**: "Designed", "Implemented", "Optimized", not just "Worked on".
-   **Metrics**: "Improved performance by 30%" is better than "Improved performance".
-   **Skills Section**: List languages and tools you are actually comfortable with.

### Portfolio
-   **Quality over Quantity**: 2-3 deep, deployed projects are better than 10 tutorials.
-   **Readme**: Every project needs a good README (What it is, Tech Stack, How to Run).
-   **Live Demo**: If possible, host it (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku).

## 4. Assessment Strategy

### During the Coding Interview
1.  **Clarify**: Ask questions. "Is the input sorted?", "Can it be negative?"
2.  **Examples**: Walk through a sample case manually.
3.  **Brute Force**: Mention the naive solution first if optimal isn't obvious.
4.  **Optimize**: discussing time/space complexity before coding.
5.  **Code**: Write clean, modular code.
6.  **Test**: Dry run your code with edge cases (empty, large, negative).

### Common Mistakes
-   Jumping to code immediately.
-   Ignoring edge cases.
-   Silent coding (Think Aloud!).
-   Giving up (Always ask for hints if stuck).
